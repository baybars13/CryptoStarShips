# Gameplay

We will start with a click to earn game style to evolve this project and turn it into a metaverse for this new world of ours. the development of this to be able to play later in **3D**. Among this we will create planets for stacking and be able to benefit from it, with the sales and purchases fee, market fee for fuel and maintenance of the **Starships**. All this will be divided according to their percentages among all the planets. There are many more things in development for this game that we will reveal in detail, depending on how we evolve. Don't stay behind **Pilot**.

There are **common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary** rarities, with **Legendary** being the highest. The differences between these rarities include:

* **Win Rate** - This is what you can't see, but it will greatly affect your **ROI** (luck does affect, too, as these are statistics). Your chance of being the first / second / third / fourth / fifth with each rarity class varies depending on the set of attributes obtained.&#x20;
* **Damage** taken in **Starships** depends on ranking position.
* **1º** 0%**Damage/** **2º** 2% **Damage/**  **3º** 4% **Damage/**  **4º** 6% **Damage/** **5º** 8% **Damage.**
* **KERO** Capacity: Common / Uncommon **100**, Rare ships have **125 KERO** capacity, Epic ships have **150, KERO** capacity and Legendary ships have 175 **KERO** capacity.
* **Statistics**: Power affects your contribution in **WORLD BOSS**, speed, attack and LVL affect your ability in **PvP** (hint: **PvP** will be similar to training, but you will do it against ships of other captains and guess what, in real time and with higher rewards).
* **Daily Withdrawal Limit**: Once the **Starships** fusion feature is updated, your daily withdrawal limit will be calculated based on your number of ships and their rarity. Having more ships of higher rarity gives you a higher limit, but you cannot exceed  **500 $CSSR** every **24** hours.
